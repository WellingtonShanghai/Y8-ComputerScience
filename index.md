## Welcome to Y8 Computer Science: Group Project

### Objectives:
- To develop research and information synthesising skill
- To develop time and task management skill
- To develop and enforcing problem solving and practical programming skill
- To develop presentation and communication skill

### What to Expect

- You are expected to work in a group of two
- You are expected to use nine lessons to complete a task of your choice from a given list of topics
- For your chosen topic, you are expected to:
  1. conduct some in-depth research on the topic
  2. come up with a list of quiz like questions 
  3. program a quiz using a programming language of your choice, such as Scratch, or Python using the quiz questions from bulletin point 2
  4. present your research work using PowerPoint, Publisher, Canva or webpages to the class

### A List of Tasks/Topics for You to Choose
#### Task/Topic 1: heathy life style
```markdown
Some research starting point for you:
  1. What is heathy life style?
  2. What aspects are there for a healthy life style such as, diet, exercise and habits which include drinking, smoking, screen time etc
  3. Once you have a list of broad aspects, you can then as a group to divide tasks to research in-depth for each aspect
  4. For each aspect, you can then come up with a list of quiz questions - make sure the questions can be answered judged easily by using programming languages

Example questions:
  1. At least how many minutes of moderate intensity activity a week is considered to be essential for a healthy life style? (the answer 150 is an easy answer using programming language to judge)
  2. Ideally, adults should limit their screen time to how many hours oer day?


```
#### Task/Topic 2: A Topic of your own choice that related to your subject of study
