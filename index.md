  2. come up with a list of quiz like questions 
  3. program a quiz using a programming language of your choice, such as Scratch, or Python using the quiz questions from bulletin point 2
  4. present your research work using PowerPoint, Publisher, Canva or webpages to the class

### A List of Tasks/Topics for You to Choose
#### Task/Topic 1: heathy life style
```markdown
Some research starting pointfor you:
  1. What is IoT?
  2. Give three examples of IoT and describe their applications
  3. Explain to your best ability the technologies used in those three examples of IoT

Choose Two Questions From the Following to Answer:
  1. How does each of your chosen IoT examples impact people's life?

```
#### Task/Topic 2: GUI - Graphic User Interface

```markdown
Mandatory Tasks for You to Work out:
  1. What is GUI?
  2. Using those three commonly used computing devices Windows PCs, iOS devices, and Andriod devices, 
  explain their design intentions

      * how they different from each other? why?
      * Pick one from the three GUIs, *list of things* you like about it and you don't like about it
  3. You are going to *re-design* one of the three GUIs above using a graphics software to 
  suit your own needs and justify your design intentions

Choose Two Tasks From the Following to Work out:
  1. Using examples, explain why GUI is important.
  2. Explain how GUIs can help people with special needs.
  3. What are command/action based interfaces? giving examples.

``` 

#### Task/Topic 3: Am I Seeing a Pattern?

```
Mandatory Tasks for You to Work out:
  1. Data visualizations 
  2. Spotting Data trends using simple data analysis
  3. Explain the given data in context and come up with a meaningful and relevant hypothesis

Detailed tasks about this topic is explained in the spreadsheet on class Notebook, Unit 0 section. Follow the link below.
