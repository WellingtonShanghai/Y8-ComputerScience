## Welcome to Y8 Computer Science: Group Project

### Objectives:
- To develop research and information synthesising skill
- To develop time and task management skill
- To develop and enforcing problem solving and practical programming skill
- To develop presentation and communication skill

### Expectations

- You are expected to work in a group of two
- You are expected to use nine lessons to complete a task of your choice from a given list of topics
- For your chosen topic, you are expected to:
  1. Conduct some in-depth research on the topic
  2. Divide the topic into broad aspects/categories 
  3. Come up with a list of quiz like questions for each aspect/category 
  4. Program a quiz using a programming language of your choice, such as Scratch, or Python using the quiz questions from bulletin point 2

  2. What aspects are there for a healthy life style such as, diet, exercise and habits which include drinking, smoking, screen time etc
  3. Once you have a list of broad aspects, you can then as a group to divide tasks to research in-depth for each aspect
  4. For each aspect, you can then come up with a list of quiz questions - make sure the questions can be answered judged easily by using programming languages
  5. Make sure you have at last 15 questions

Example questions:
  1. At least how many minutes of moderate intensity activity a week is considered to be essential for a healthy life style? (the answer 150 is an easy answer using programming language to judge)
